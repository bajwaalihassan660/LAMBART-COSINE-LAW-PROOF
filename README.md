# LAMBART-COSINE-LAW-PROOF
LAMBART COSINE LAW PROOF (HARDWARE)
I developed a hardware project to experimentally prove Lambert's Cosine Law, which states that the radiant intensity observed from a Lambertian surface is proportional to the cosine of the angle between the direction of the incident light and the surface normal.

Skills Gained:

Experimental Design and Setup
Use of Photometer and Light Measurement Techniques
Data Collection and Analysis
Understanding of Radiant Intensity and Reflectance Properties
Practical Application of Lambert's Cosine Law
